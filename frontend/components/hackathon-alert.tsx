              I'm participating in the MLB Hackathon, <strong>tackling Challenge #5</strong>, titled{' '}
              <strong>{config.appName}</strong>. My goal is to make baseball more exciting for fans by creating a tool
              that helps them follow young talented players and predict their future potential. My tool will display
              player stats, historical data, and live updates — information typically reserved for baseball experts. I'm
              making baseball viewing more interactive by letting fans make data-driven predictions about players, share
              their insights with other fans, and compare their picks with experts. This creates a deeper connection to
              the sport. The tool will enhance key moments like draft days and league promotions, allowing fans to track
              their favorite prospects' journeys. This transforms casual viewers into passionate fans invested in their
              team's future. Through this combination of sports, technology, and social features, I'm working to
