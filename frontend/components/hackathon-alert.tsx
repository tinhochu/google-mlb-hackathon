              . My goal is to make baseball more exciting for fans by creating a tool that helps them follow young
              talented players and predict their future potential. My tool will display player stats, historical data,
              and live updates â€” information typically reserved for baseball experts. I&apos;m making baseball viewing
              more player stats, historical data, and live updates â€” information typically reserved for baseball
              experts. I&apos;m making baseball viewing more interactive by letting fans make data-driven predictions
              about players, share their insights with other fans, and compare their picks with experts. This creates a
              deeper connection to the sport. The tool will enhance key moments like draft days and league promotions,
              allowing fans to track their favorite prospects&apos; journeys. This transforms casual viewers into
              passionate fans invested in their team&apos;s future. Through this combination of sports, technology, and
