## Project Overview

I'm participating in the MLB Hackathon, **tackling Challenge #5**, titled **MLB™ P3: Prospect Potential Predictor**. My goal is to make baseball more exciting for fans by creating a tool that helps them follow young talented players and predict their future potential. My tool will display player stats, historical data, and live updates — information typically reserved for baseball experts.

I'm making baseball viewing more interactive by letting fans make data-driven predictions about players, share their insights with other fans, and compare their picks with experts. This creates a deeper connection to the sport.

The tool will enhance key moments like draft days and league promotions, allowing fans to track their favorite prospects' journeys. This transforms casual viewers into passionate fans invested in their team's future.

Through this combination of sports, technology, and social features, I'm working to make baseball more engaging and accessible for everyone.

Stay tuned as we innovate and bring our ideas to life!
